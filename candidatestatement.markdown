As Chair of Trafford Young Labour and as LGBT+ Officer for Stretford and Urmston CLP, I have first-hand experience of the unacceptable lack of safeguarding training available to Young Labour groups and young members. I’ve also seen first-hand a slow and ineffective complaints system, which needs urgent work.

If you elect me, I pledge to:

– Vocally stand against transphobia in all its forms and work with the national committee to lobby the Party to adopt a definition of transphobia.

– Act as a champion for safeguarding reform in Young Labour, calling for accessible safeguarding training for young members and youth officers.

– Work with LGBT+ Labour for events and parades to be truly accessible to young members.

– Write full and detailed reports on each National Committee meeting.

I am not standing to be LGBT+ Officer to push my own opinions onto a committee, I’m standing because we need a representative who will listen to young LGBT+ members, and who will actively be your voice on the national committee.

Thank you for reading, I’d be honoured to win your vote.
